1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive.
* HTML is for structure
* CSS is for styling
* JavaScript is for behavior (e.g., clicks, animations, API calls)
JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

2. Why Learn JavaScript?
* It runs on every browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* No setup required — just a browser
* Used for:
  Web development (front-end and back-end)
  Mobile apps (React Native)
  Desktop apps (Electron)
  Game development
  IoT (Internet of Things)

3. Where Does JavaScript Run?
-> Browser (Client-side)
   * JS runs inside the browser using engines like:
   * Chrome → V8
   * Firefox → SpiderMonkey
   * Safari → JavaScriptCore

-> Outside the Browser (Server-side)
   * Using Node.js, JavaScript can run on the server
   * Great for building APIs, real-time apps (like chats), etc.

4. Key Features of JavaScript
   Feature	                     Description
* Dynamic Typing      -> No need to declare data types
* Interpreted	        -> Runs line-by-line
* Prototype-based OOP	-> Object-oriented with prototype chains
* Single-threaded	    -> Executes one task at a time (uses Event Loop to manage async)
* Case-sensitive	    -> Name and name are different
* Lightweight & Fast	-> Optimized for web use

5. Fundamental Concepts (You’ll Learn Later in Series)
* Variables: var, let, const
* Data Types: string, number, boolean, object, etc.
* Operators: +, -, ==, ===, etc.
* Functions
* Arrays & Objects
* Loops: for, while, forEach
* Conditional Statements: if, else, switch
* DOM Manipulation
* Events & Listeners
* Promises & Async-Await
* Closures, Hoisting, TDZ
* ES6+ Features
